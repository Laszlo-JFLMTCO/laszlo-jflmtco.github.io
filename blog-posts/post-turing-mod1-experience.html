          <h2>Wow, post Mod1!</h2>
          <p>Though it has been only six weeks since we attended our first class at Turing, but it definitely feels like time has stopped and we eactually lived through a year while everybody else lived just six weeks.</p>
          <p>My Mod1 experience has been very positive! Riding on a strong willingness to learn and absorb as much knowledge as possible, I've come a long way from where I have been as a programmer at the beginning of October. And now preparing for Thanksgiving I can't help but feel confident that despite I don't expect it to be easy at all, but I will be able to push through anything Mod2 will throw at me.</p>
          <h2>Being positive</h2>
          <p>One great contrast in a positive way once you enter Turing is others' willingness to help you or just simply have a smile sent to your way.</p>
          <p>As a Mod1 student anybody will know what you are going through and that develops this unique sympathy towards each others' situation.</p>
          <p>So I stopped being surprised by random people asking how I am doing and even offering their help just in case I need it!</p>
          <h2>My favorite technical concept: Recursion</h2>
          <p>Definitely my favorite as it allows us to build very powerful methods with very short code.</p>
          <p>Also in a way once I got a decent handle on the concept and start implementing it in the various projects we worked on, it gave me this boost of confidence that I am not that hopeless and one day actually become a cool programmer...</p>
          <code><pre>

      def find_words_on_branch(node, word_suggestion)
        word_suggestion += node.letter
        suggestions << word_suggestion if node.terminator?
        find_words_on_branch(node, word_suggestion) if node.has_children?
      end
            </pre>
          </code>
          <p>The above example is from our <a href = "https://github.com/Laszlo-JFLMTCO/Complete-Me" target = "_blank">Complete-Me project</a>, where we implemented a smartphone-like autocomplete feature. Behind the scenes we had a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list" target = "_blank">linked list</a> that stored about 250,000 words. Nodes were the various branches within our tree of nodes. While typing, our implementation allowed to request the list of words available in our dictionary based on the the text already typed. In order to scan through the branches, we used recursion, where our method <code>find_words_on_branch</code> started calling itself until no more nodes were available. In order to avoid an infinite loop, during recursive method calls, it is important to set an exit criteria. In our case the <code>if node.has_children?</code> evaluation served this purpose.</p>
          <p>I knew you will get excited, too... :-)</p>
