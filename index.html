        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the main page of my site that I created as part of the Module 2 prework at <a href = "https://www.turing.io/" target = "_blank">Turing School of Software and Design</a>.</p>
        <p>As part of our prework, we will have to work on several different mini projects during our intermission covering several different topics. One of those topics is related to HTML/CSS. This website is the outcome of that prework assignment. Select any of the menu items in the sidebar on the left or <a href = "https://github.com/turingschool/intermission-assignments/blob/master/prep-for-module-2-backend.markdown" target = "_blank">click here to read the Module 2 Prep Work description</a>.</p>
        <p>As I maintain a personal website already, the content here will be limited to cover the Module 2 Prep Work requirements. You can find my personal website by visiting: <a href = "http://laszlo.thebaloghs.com/" target = "_blank">laszlo.thebaloghs.com</a></p>
        <div class = "content-divider-dark"></div>
        <h2>Main topics covered here:</h2>
        <p>From the three options listed for self learning HTML/CSS, I picked the first option: going through <a href = "http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/" target = "_blank">Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML & CSS</a>. Then built this site (Task #2) and completed the Bootstrap assignment (Task #3).</p>

          <div class = "col-1-2">
            <h2>HTML/CSS Task #2</h2>
            <div class = "content-divider-light"></div>
            <img class = "github-icon" src = "assets/pics/github-icon-white-256.png">
            <p>We had to use the HTML and CSS skills we learned to build a personal blog site:</p>
            <p>Build a personal site with a blog portion using plain HTML and CSS. At minimum. The site had to contain an index.html, styles.css, and a first blog post about our Mod 1 experience and our favorite technical concept: insert-first-post-title-here.html.</p>
            <p>We also had to push the project to Github Pages.</p>

            <p>We had to go through a series of Bootstrap related exercises.</p>
            <p>Once done with the exercises, we had to push our results to Github.</p>
